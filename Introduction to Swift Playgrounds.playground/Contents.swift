//ASSIGNMENT #2 BEGIN _______________________________
//var myFirstVariable = "Iʻve created my first variable"
//var is only used when declaring the variable
var myFirstVariable: String

myFirstVariable = "Iʻve created my first variable"
//myFirstVariable = "5"

/* use this to comment a block of code*/
//this is how to comment out a single line of code

var mySecondVariable = " and look I added 2 strings together"

//Part 7 String Concantenation
//essentially myFirstVariable + mySecondVariable

var myThirdVariable = myFirstVariable + mySecondVariable

print(myThirdVariable)

//SOLUTION+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

//Part 9 On Your Own

//1. Declare three new variables and assign each of them to a different string. (6 points possible, 2 points/variable)

var stringOne = "Hello, "
var stringTwo = "my name is "
var stringThree = "Marion Ano."

// 2. Create a fourth variable and assign it to the string  concatenation that combines all three strings (2 points possible)

var fullString = stringOne + stringTwo + stringThree

//3. Use the print function to print the fourth variable (2 points possible)

print(fullString)

//Part 10: Push to Github (2 points)

//ASSIGNMENT #2 END______________________________________

//ASSIGNMENT #3 BEGIN Introduction to True and False________________

var appState = false
print(appState)

//Part 4
//create 2 new variables of type int

var numberOne = 5
var numberTwo = 7

//We are going to create a statement that compares the two variables and assign that statement to a third variable

var comparison = numberOne > numberTwo

//SOLUTION+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

//Part 7: ON YOUR OWN PART 1: USING THE "EQUAL TO" OPERATOR
//NOTE: == is the equal to operator

//1. Create two new variables and assign those variables to two different strings. (worth 2 points)

var firstString = "I live in Hawaiʻi."
var secondString = "Where do you live?"

//2. Create a third variable that is set to (or assigned to) the statement that evaluates your two variables equal to each other. (worth 2 points)

var resultString = firstString == secondString

// Print the third variable. (worth 2 points)

print(resultString)

//Part 8: On Your Own Part 2: Repeat Assignment #1 (3 points if completed)

//ASSIGNMENT #3 END_____________________________________________
